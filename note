## Problem Description:

One of the primary objectives of CIPAM is to create educational tools and resources for Intellectual Property Awareness at school level. School students learn best when technical areas of law are gamified and interactive in nature. The interactive gaming software/mobile application should aim at teaching the basics of Iintellectual Pproperty Rrights (IPR) to students, including: Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Designs that can be used both inside and outside of the classroom and out. 

The game can have different activities on the IPs mentioned above, arranged at different levels of progression: basic, intermediate and advanced. 

It should also include elements such as: scoreboard, map of progress, factual titbits and a quick recap at the end. On completion of the game, the students should be able have a basic understanding of these IPs as a learning outcome.
